# Card-points-game
This is a Cards points game application based on the concept of a slot machine in casino. 

There are three cards drawn at random on click of the draw floating action button. If you get two cards of the same value out of the three, 
you get 50 points. If you get all the cards of the same value, you get 100 times the value of the card. The total score is calculated and
you can reset the game anytime to start playing again.
